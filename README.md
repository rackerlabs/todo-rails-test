#Rackspace Software Developer Ruby on Rails Take Home Test

## Instructions
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and clone this repository
2. Complete "Requirements"


## Requirements
Update the existing code to provide the following functionality:

1. Add ability to set a due date on a Task
2. Add ability to sort Tasks by due date
3. Update the ListsController so that every action responds to JSON
4. Apply Bootstrap [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) to make the UI more appealing

These updates should be **_all your own work_**, and it does not need to be complicated.  Fewer tested features are preferred over many buggy features.

**Good luck!**
